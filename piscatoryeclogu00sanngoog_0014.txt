PREFACE

THE favorable reception accorded to my edition oi “ good
old Mantuan '’ has encouraged me to make a similar study
oi the much better eclogues oi Sannazaro.

The text is based upon that of the first printed edition,
of NapleS, 1526. The inore important later variants are
mentioned in the notes The spelling is modified to suit the
convenience of the modern reader. The punctuation is
my own.

Through the good offices oi J. A. Hatram, Esq., of the
British Museum, Ι had secured a ‘rotograph’ copy of the

Editio Princeps And through a similar courtesy on the
part of Abbe PAUL Lrnnnnar, I am able to print Sannazaro's
piscatory fragment as it stands in the Vatican ‘autograph ’.

1 hope that most of my obligations to earlier writers are
duly acknowledged in the iootnotes. But there is one ex-

, ,οεΠεῐη book which seems to have been left for special men-

tion here: La Pocria Pastorale, by Eunico Caranus, Milan,

1909.
