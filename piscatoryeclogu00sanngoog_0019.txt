12 INTRODUCTION

Ι thrown (1501) he went into voluntary exile with his sover-
eign and remained in Franco until after Federico’s death
ι’ (Sept. 9, 1504). Returning to Naples, he lived in the
villa which Federico had given him, and, Pontano being
now dead, his house became the chief meeting-place of the
Academy. He died April 24, 1530. He was buried in the
little church of S. Maria del Parto which he had erccted in
his villa. And Pietro Bembo wrote his epitaph:

“ncrrus srucnnus ”

. ,His Academic name was ‘Actius Syncerus ’. 'l'he mean-
ing of this name is obscure, but it is certain that he received
it, or assumed it, quite early in his literary career—as early,

, at least, as 1481.3 Paulus Jovius says that hc took it at the
suggestion of Pontano: “cum praeclarum fecundi atque
felicis ingenii specimen daret, repudiato avito gentilitioque
nomine, Actius Syncerus appellari voluit, adhortante Pon-
tan0, qui Ioviani cognomen amicorum imitatione desum·
serat ’'.⁴ And there are similar statements in the Vitae by
Gio. Battista Crispo, G. Ant. Volpi and F rancesco Colangelo.

All three of these Vitae add that he was named ‘Syncerus'
because of his personal character and the character of his
writings Crispo says: “et allo stile et alla dolce et leal
sua natura parimente hauendo riguardo ’'.⁵ Volpi has:
“ quod sine fuco et fallaciis vitam ageret ”.⁶ And Colangelo

says: ‘⁴ in perpetuo monumento della maravigliosa ingenuita

³111 the dedication of Pontano’s De Liberalitate he is addressed as
‘Sincere Acti ’, and in this treatise Mahommed ll is mentioned as
still alive: “ Mahometum qui nunc Turcis ac Graecis imperat '³ (G.
Rosalba, Le Egloglze Percotorie di J. Sannararo, Neapoli, 1908, p. 41).
In the Arcadia, a work composed “uela prima adolescentia del
poeta ’'‚ he refers to himself as ‘Sincero '. And in two of his earlier
poems‚ Eleg. 1, 10, 23, and 11, 7, 71, he calls himself ‘Actius ’.
