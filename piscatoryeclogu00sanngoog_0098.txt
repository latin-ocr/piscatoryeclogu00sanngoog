FRAGMENTUM.

The text 01 this fragment is taken from the ‘autograph' in the
Vatican Library (Cod. Lat. 3361). 11 was not printed with the
other eclogues in the Naples edition 01 1516, 01 111 the Paris edition
01 15273 but it must have been circulated soon afterwards, 101 11 is
imitated in Berardino Rota’s fourteenth ecloguc. It is printed in
the Aldine edition 01 1535; but this shows a good many variant read·
ingS, and the poem is not divided, as here, between two singers.
Rota's imitation suggests that he had the poem in much the same
form as the Aldine edition gives it.

The same Vatican MS. (fol. 101) has what looks like an early
drait 01 the introduction, in Sannazaro's own hand:

Optatos iam Euplca mihi circumspice saleis
Quo liceat trepidas piscanti includere praedas Ἴ
Ao Zephyris releuare graues spirantibus aestus
Si te certa mouet velocis gratia cymbae
Tuque adeso nostri merces non parua laboris
Quam Phoebus mihi, quam doctae mea turba puellae
Conciliant. dumque ipse hamos ac retia pando
Da vela insinuans, pelagoque excurre patenti
Pars animae Puderice meae, te nam sua Nereus
Per vada, te medio Doris vocat aemula ponto
Qua late horrisonum campus strepit omnis aquarum

111 llline 6 the name Triton is marked out, and Phoebus written' above

150 doct tae (6) has been substituted for virides, ac (7) 10101, and
vocat (10) 101 canit. tIn line 11 campus was written as the second
word, then marked out and transferredto the fourth place.

In the Aldine edition, the second line 01 the Vat' trcan fragment
does not appear at all; line 16 is completed‚ by the words et tempora
quattuor 0001,· lines 37· 42 are inserted ast ter line 243 lines 40· 41 read:
