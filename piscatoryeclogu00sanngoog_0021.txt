INTRODUCTION

“ sxnsxs nnscnuor noo paruus xo uxnxs ’'

In his Piscatory Eclogues Sannazaro professed to he
playing the part of a pionecr.¹³ Thus at iv. 17 he writes:

⁴ nunc litoream ne despice Musam
quam tibi post silvas, post horrida lustra Lycaei
(si quid id est) salsas deduxi primus ad undas,
ausus inexperta tentare pericula cymba.

And in Eleg. iii. 2, 57-58 he has:

quandoquidem salsas descendi ego primus ad undas,
ausus inexpertis reddere verba sonis.

·’ This claim ignores certain of the ldyls ol Theocritus (vi,
xi, xxi) an author whom Sannazaro knew very well. But it

was allowed by his contemporaries for example hy Lodovieo
Ariost0, O. F. xlvi. 17:

Iacobo Sanazar, ch’ alle Camene
Lasciar fa i monti et abitar l'arene3

and Lilius Gregorius Gyraldus, Epistola ad Antonium
T hebaldeum:

et Syncerus abest, cecinit qui primus in acta
non prius auditum carmen, quo gurgite ab alto
prosiluit Triton simul et chorus Amphitrites.1⁴

And it has regularly been admitted hy his later readers
