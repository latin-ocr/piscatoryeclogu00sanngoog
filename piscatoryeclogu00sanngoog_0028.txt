SANNAZARO'S POPULARITY 21

speak of “the admirable Latin Piscatories of that noble
Neapolitan Sanazar0”. ln the dedication of his Sylva
ἒῖἵζιὲζθέὴὶῃεειε Fletcher has an allusion to the Piscatory

Quin fixos super appendens modo retia remos
Italicus scopulos inter Piscator et undas
Parthenopae canit et piscosae Mergilinae.

And he has another in The Purplr leland, i. 13:

And now os late th’ Italian imber-swain
Sits on the shore to watch his trembling line3
There reaches rocks and prouder scas to plain
By Nesis fair and fairer Mergiline:
While his thinne net, upon his oars twin’d‚ etc.

Compare, especially, Ecl. iii. 10:

raraque per longos pendebant retia remos.

In the dedicatory epistle prefixed to the Eclogues of
Joannes Leochaeus Scotus,³8 Sannazaro is still regarded as
a pioneer—though Leochaeus himself knew, and imitated,
the twenty-first Idyl of T heocritus.3⁹ This Scottish poet
has twenty eclogueS, divided into four groups (‘ bucolicae ',
‘ piscatoriae ⁵, ‘nauticae ’, and ‘ampelicae’ sive ‘vinitoriae ')‚
and he claims some credit for their variety: “ namque, ut
Bucolica excipias in quibus non pauci: quis oro praeter
Sanazariurn Piscatorios Eclogos: quis praeter Hugonem
Gratiam Nauticas tentavit? ⁴⁰ et illius (quod dolori maximo
esse possit) ecquid praeter unicum Nauticum exstat Idyl·

³⁸ Musae Priores, sive Poematum Pars Prior, Londini‚ 1620.
³⁹ In his fourth ‘ecloga piscatoria ’, Thaumasto.

4⁰Piscatory. eclogues had been written by Berardino Rota, Ber·
nardo Tasso, Bernardino Baldi, Camoens, Belleau, and others. In his
Myrtilus, sive Idyllr'um Nauticum, Grotius professed to be playing
the partos a pioneer: “Prima mihi, sylvis et amoeno fonte relicto, Ι
fistula ad Oceani fluctus etad aequora venit’'; but nautical eclogues
had already been written by Lorenzo Gambara. Grotius' poem is an
imitation of Theocritus (111, 6-7, 21·27, 37-39; xx, 19-323 xxr, 8-12).
And it is itself paraphrased in Sarasin's eclogue, Myutt, oo le Nomou-
mer.
