‘⁴ Thelgon, a poore fisher-swain” (the name from Sann.
Ecl. v) sits under a “ rocky canopic '' and there sings “to
seas and rocks '’. Cp. Sann. Ecl. ii. l, ‘sorte Lycon vacuo
fessus consederat antro l piscator‚' etc. His phrase ‘withy
labyrinths'‚ st. 5, comes from Ecl. iii. 12, and the lines,
’ st. 6:

There while our thinne nets dangliug in the winde
Hung on our oars tops,

from Ecl. iii. 10. The opening staura of the second
eclogue, Tkirsr'l :

Myrtil why idle sit we on the shore?

Since stormy windes and waves intestine spite
Impatient rage os sail or bending oare;

Sit we and sing, while windes and waters fight3
And carol lowd os love, and loves delight,

should be compared with Ecl. iii. 1-10. And so should
the opening stanna of the third, Myrtilus:

His dangling nets (hung on the trembling oare)
Had leave to play, so had his idle hook,
While madding windes the madder Ocean shook.

In the same third eclogue, stanza 17:

See, see, sair Caelia, seas are calmly laid,

And end their boisterous threats in quiet peace;

The waves their drummes, the windes their trumpets cease:
But my sick love (ah love full ill apayd l)

Never can hope his storms may be allayd; etc,

may be compared with Ecl. ii. 11-16. In the seventh
eclogue‚ The Prize‚ the second stanza:

Stella, whose love his life, and whose disdain
Seems worse then angry skies, or never quiet main,

reminds one of Ecl. iii. 59-613 the thirteenth:

Proteus, thy song to heare,
Seas list’ning stand, and windes to whistle {cart

The lively Delphins donce, and brisly Seales gine eure„
