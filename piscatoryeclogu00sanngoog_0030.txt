sim tlte Works os Sannazarius, H. Grotius, Bapt. Amal-
t eus, e a:

I am not insensible that a late celebrated Author, in some of his
Criticisms, has iound Fault -with Sannazarius for choosing the Sea
for the Scene of his Eclogues, and for introducing F ishermen and
their Nets, instead os Shepherds and their Flocks; But he might
have considered, that these Poems were designed chiefly to honour
his Native Country, which, being a Maritime Place, could not, conse-
quently, be a proper Scene for Pastorals: Besides, 'tis certain, that a
Plan may be contriv'd‚ and a Poem written upon any of the Orna-
mental Parts oi Nature; andis the Incidents be justly laid, the De·

scriptions compleat, and the Characters truly drawn, the Poem must '

be perfect.

Now as the Hills and Vales, the Woods and Lawns, are the Seenes
os a Pastoral Poem, so the Sea and the Sea-shores are the Scenes of
these Eclogues; which, in their very Nature, differ as widely from
Pastorals, as the Two Elements from each other.

'Tis true, the Earth, array'd in all her vernal Glory, atlords a
more agreeable Prospect; it eharms the Eye with a greater Diver-
sity of Objects, and, consequently, gives an Opportunity sor a Poet
to entertain his Readers with a more pleasing Variety of lmages;
But still the Sea, and the adjacent Shores, may yield Matter sulli-
cient, tho’ not altogether so copious, for a Work of a different Kind;
and Whales‚ Delphins, Tritons, and Syrens may be introduced there
to as good purpose, as Goats on the Mountains, or Oxen in the Vales.
Shells and Corals and Oysters are as proper ior a Fisherman to pre·
sent to his Mistress‚ as Cups and Flutes and sheep-crooks are sor a
Shepherd, and Proteus, and Glaucus, certainly, are as much Sover-
eigns of the Sea, as Pan, and Sylvanus of the Land.

A Sea-skip, therefore, well describ’d‚ is far from striking us with
that Horrour, which this Author would insinuate, . . .

Here, Ι will take Leave of this Gentleman, who seems to have
used a Freedom with Sannazarius, that, to say no worse of it, tres-
passes both upon Decency and good manners.

ln 1729 there appeared a further proof that Sannazaro
had not been wholly torgotten. ln that year Moses Browne
published his Piscatory Eclogoes: ‘An Essay to Introduce
new Rules and new Characters into Pastoral. To which is
prefixed a Discussion in Defence of this Undertaking’.
The book was published anonymously, and the dedication
'signed ‘Immerito’. The ‘defence' is a defence of
Browne’s own eclogueS, notos Sannazaro's l quote a part
oi it from the ‘second edition, corrected and enlarged’
which he printed in his Poems on Variam Sabjects, Lon·
don, 1739. This shows one or two werhal changes {corn
the first edition. ’
