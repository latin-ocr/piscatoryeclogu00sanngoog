Since he is gone, I’ll setch him to my Arms

By sacred Spells, and soree of Magick Charms.
Search in the Shme, you'll find the Cramp-fish there,
That chilling stops whatever swims too near:

You’ll find the Fish that stays the labouring ship,
Tho’ ruffling Winds drive o’er the noisy Deep:

So Phorbas, while from me he perjur’d flies,

Is struck benumb'd‚ and fix’d with strange 'Surprise

with Ecl. v. 55-58. The twelfth poem reports a dialogue
between two fishermen, and the last two (xiii, xiv) contain
some curious information about fishes

The Piscatory Eclogues oi Moses Browne were first pub·
lished (London, 1729) with the sub-title “an Essay to'
introduce new Rules and new Characters into Pastoral’'.
They are not a mere paraphrase or a slavish imitation of
Sannazaro's poems; indeed, their author was “flatter'd to
believe his Endeayours would meet with a more favourable
Acceptance, if Sanazarius had never wrote his Sea·
Eelogues ’'. Still, the second, The N octurnol may remind
the reader of Sannazaro’s second 3 and ‘Renock' is a sort
of eighteenth-century ‘ Lycon ἰ

Coy Maid! lost lovely Sweet! ah, you can rest,
While I still wake with cruel Cares opprest‚
Blest Pow'r of Sleep! her Eye=lids gently close,
Melt her soit Dreams with Renock's dying Woes!

The scene of the third, lee Sea Sasine, may recall San·
nazaro’s third. “A Company of Fishers, iorc'd in their
Boats from Sea, by bad Weather‚ take Harbour up a shady
Stream‚ where they divert and refresh themselves '’. The

poem begins:

By a close Creek, with shelt’ring Rocks confin’d‚
While the Seas echo’d to the vexing Wind,

Old Chromis in his dancing Boat withdrew‚

To mix in Pastimes with the herbousd Crew.

Here while their Oars the idle Nets sustain

(Drove from their Labours on the madding Mein)
The F isim-Sira in Skill experienc’d long,

The Youths now challenge for his promis’d Song.⁶1

⁰1Qu0ted from Poems on Various Subsects, London‚ 1739. Here
this eclogue stands fourth in the series, and a {ew verbal changes

haye been made.
