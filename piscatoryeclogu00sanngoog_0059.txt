ln his second ‘ecloga nautica ’, the words of ‘Aegialeus ’:

quem mihi Donensis custos dedit aequoris olim,
dum canerem, dixitque ‘tuae haec sint praemia Musae,
quandoquidem nostra cecinit non talis in acta ³,

are an echo of Ecl. ii. 41-45. And the mention of “ditis
proles Polybotae’‘ is due to Ecl. ii. 18. In the third,
Plzroura, two of the songs:

Creta Iovi magno, sua Mercurio Cyllene,
Vulcano Lemnos, Veneri gratissima Cyprus,
Litha meae Panopae; si Lithae commoda norint,
Vulcanus Lemnon, linquet Venus aurea Cyprum,

and

Bacchus amat Thebas, doctas Tritonia Athenas,
Mars Rhodopen iactat, proles Latonia Delon;
Edini turres dum mellea Chloris amabit,

nec Rhodope Edinum vincet, nec candida Delos,

are copied from Sannazaro, Ecl. iii. 70-77. ln the fifth,
Eclm, the passage:

Vitatur Boreas, Auster vitatur et Eurus,

vitatur nix cana, imbres, gelidaeque pruinae,
omnia vitantur; sed amorem et spicula mortis
non modus effugere est, nec ab his fas currere,

is au imitation of Ecl. ii. 71-72.

In the tenth eclogue of W. Diaper's Nereides ⁰⁰ a mer-
maid (‘ Meroe') tries to call back her faithless lover by
enchantment53 and some of the charms she uses are bor-
rowed from Sannazaro’s ‘Herpylis’. Compare, for ex-
ample, the lines:

⁰⁰ Nereides: or Sea-Eclogues, London, 1712. The book was pub-
lished anonymously, and the author’s name is osten misspelled. He
is mentioned in Swift’s Journal to Stella, xrrrr, 12: “Here is a
young fellow has writ some Sea Eclogues, Poems of Mermen, re·
sembling pastorals and shepherds, and they are very pretty, and the
thought is new. . . . His name is Diaper’ss A copy in the Colum·
bia University Library bears an inscription by “The Author. W. D,
March 12, 1712 ’'. For some account oi these poems, see H. M. Hall,

lairlls of Ftiherman, New York, 1912, Pl)- issss-tbq„
