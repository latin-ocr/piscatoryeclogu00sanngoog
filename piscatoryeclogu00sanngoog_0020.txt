“ACTIUS SYNCERUS” 13

di quell' amicizia, che gli mostrava’'.⁷ But these state-

ments need not be taken any more seriously than some of the
complimentary addresses of his contemporaries—for ex-
ample, a poem by Giovanni *Pardo (a reply to Eleg. i. 2) :

Acti, cui simplex peperit facundia nomen
Sinceri et vitae candida simplicitas,⁸

or a letter from Pietro Bembo (April 13, 1505) : “ atque illa
in primis vel probitate vel morum animique, si Latine satis
possum dicere, synceritate, quae quidem virtus tibi etiam

agnomen dedit, politissimus '’.⁹ Probably ‘Syncerus' was Ι

merely a complimentary modification of the Latinized name
‘ Sannazarius '.1⁰

As for the name ‘Actius’, Volpi says that it was given
“quod ille princeps ex Latinis bucolico poemate piscatores
de amoribus suis in acta colloquentes induxisset ἘΠ This
seems to be amere inference from a passage in the second
Eclogue (45): “quandoquidem nostra cecinisti primus in
acta ’'. And it can hardly be right, unless it refers to some
earlier piscatory eclogues than the five which have been
preserved. Others have connected the name with the situa-
tion of the Villa Mergillina—a villa which Sannazaro did
not possess until 1497-01 with Virgil's ‘Apollo Actius'
(‘Actium’s Apollo ³) Aen. viii. 704.12 Possibly it was sug-
gested by the epithet in Theocritus v. 14, Πὰν birros (‘ Pan
of the shore'). Such a guess would at least fit in with·
Sannazaro’s early devotion to pastoral, and with his early
acquaintance with Theocritus.

¹⁰ So his friend Benedetto Gareth received the Academic name of
‘Chariteus'-a modification of his Latinized name ‘Garetheus’ into
a form which would suggest the ‘Charites ', or Graces. Then Pon-
tano could write: “ Bearunt Charites deae ministrae, E quis, o Char·
itee‚ nomen hauris ''. And Chariteus could say of himself: “Con
le Charite, ond’ io fui Chariteo '’ (E. Percopo‚ Le Rime di Benedetto
Gareth, detto il Charites), Napoli, 1892, Introd. cxcvii, and p. 424).
