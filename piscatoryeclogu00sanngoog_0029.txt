lium? In Ampelicir nullus (quod sciam)’'. Some 01 these
poems were written in France, between 1617 0011 1620.

In the third part of Burton's Anatomy os M elaacholy (ed.
Shilleto, iii. 155) there is a rather confusing reference to
Sannazaro: “Accius Sannazariar Ecloga 2, de Galatea, in
the same manner seigns his Lycoris tormenting herself for
want of sleep, sighing, sobbing, and lamenting '’. The
⁴ lamenting in this second Eclogue is donc, not by ‘Lycoris ’‚
but by the fisherman ‘Lycon’. And the quotation in
Burton’s footnote does not come from Sannaaaro at 11.

00 April 13, 1713, the Guardiaa printed 'a criticism ,01
Sannazaro which indicates that the popularity of his Pisca-
tory Eclogues in England was then very slight:

When I am speaking 01 the ltalians, it would be unpardonable to
pass by Sannazarius. He hath changed the scene in this kind 01
poetry from woods and lawns to the barr'en beach and boundless
ocean; introduces sea-calvas 10 the room of kids and lambs, sea·
mews for the lark and the linnet‚ and presents his mistress with
oystersinstead 01 fruits and flowers. How good soever his style and
thoughts may be, yet who can pardon him for his arbitrary change
of the sweet manners and pleasing objects 01 the country, for what
in their own nature are uncomfortable and dreadful? I think he
hath few or no followers‚ or, if any, such as knew little of his
beauties‚ and only copied his faults, and so are lost and forgotten.

And the same thing is indicated by a second cssay, printed
four days later—a pleasant fable 01 the Wooiug 01
Amaryllis:

While they were in the midst 01 111011 joy, they were surprised with
a very odd appearance. A person in ablue mantle, crowned with
sedges 0011 rushes, stepped into the middle 01 the ring. 1·Ιο had an
angling rod in his hand, a pannier upon his back, and a poor meagre
wre'tch in wet clothes carried some oysters before him. Being askerl
whence he came, and what he was? he told them, he was come to in-
vite Amaryllis from the plains to the sea-shore, that his substance
consisted in sea-calves. and that he was acquainted with the Nereids
and the Naiads. ‘Art thou acquainted with the Naiads?' said
Menalcas: ‘to them then shalt thou return'. The shepherd imme-
diately hoisted him up as an enemy to Arcadia, and plungcd him in
the river, where he sunk, and was never heard of since.

Thirteen years latcr this criticism called forth a spirited
reply, in the Preface 01 john Rooke's select Translatians
